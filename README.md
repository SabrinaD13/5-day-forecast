##5-Day-Weather-Forecast


User Story:
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

Added weather Api, created the functions for it to work properly, added css to have the layout I wanted.
